# Coursera_Week4_CourseProject


"run_analysis.R" is the R-Script performing the analysis for the Course Project and generating the tidy averaged output data, which is also uploaded here in Git as "tidyaveragedDataset.txt".

"run_analysis.R" does the follwoing with the data (assuming it is already loaded into the workspace):
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
